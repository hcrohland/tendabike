        General use
      </h4>
      <p>
        TendaBike fetches all your activities and bikes from Strava.
        <br> You can create parts and attach them to your bikes. You can move parts between bikes.
        <br> TendaBike will calculate the use for any part you create.
      </p>
      <p>
        On login, TendaBike will synchronize with Strava. With that it populates the bike list. 
        <br> To create parts switch to "Spare Parts". Here you can create and attach parts.
        <br> To see the bike details click on the arrow next to the bike's name
      </p>
      <h4>
        Elevation data
      </h4>
      <p>
        Strava only tracks elevation gain. This is unfortunate if you use lifts or shuttles.
        <br>Brakes are wearing off way faster downhill than uphill while e.g. chains wear on the uphill.
        <br> If you are using a recent Garmin device and Garmin connect, we have you covered!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what you can do:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stop recording in lifts and shuttles. By that strava should not track the elevation gain for the shuttle</li>
        <li>Download the list of activities from the Garmin Connect website. The resulting file will include the elevation loss</li>
        <li>Upload this file to TendaBike via 'Sync' &rightarrow; 'Garmin' </li>
      </ol>
      Caveat: You have to download from Garmin Connect with German language settings. And it only works right now for rides done in the CET timezone.
