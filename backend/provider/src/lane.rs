//! The provider lane: the narrow seam the executor loop calls through to
//! probe and process a provider's event queue. The loop is generic over this
//! trait: it calls `probe` to read the provider's queue (one transaction's
//! housekeeping) and `process` to handle a queued event (the work
//! transaction), and never names a concrete provider. Each provider crate
//! implements it for its own lane (e.g. `tb_strava`); a second provider (a
//! new crate) implements it too, and the loop works with it unchanged. The
//! [`Probe`] outcome is generic over the provider's event type, so the
//! loop's select and reclaim policy are provider-agnostic.
